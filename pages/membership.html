<h2>Make a donation and become a member</h2>
<p>You will have the option to select different donation amounts, make it a monthly donation if you choose, and optionally share your mailing address with us for our annual membership reminder and update. Payments are securely processed by PayPal, but for one-time donations you do not need a PayPal accountâ€”you can just use any credit or debit card.</p>
<p><strong>Do you enjoy time at Bridgham Farm often?</strong> Consider checking the box on the online form and make it a monthly contribution. Even $5 a month will go a long way to help maintain the area.</p>
