<h2>What it is</h2>
<p>We are part of the Bridgham Farm Land Trust (BFLT), a private non-profit 501(c)3 organization formed to promote preservation of natural resources in the City of East Providence and to encourage sound land use practices for the benefit of the community.</p>
<p>The land trust charter permits us to acquire property, through gift or purchase, to be used in carrying out our mission.</p>
<h2>Where it is</h2>
<p>Bridgham Farm is bordered by Pleasant Street and Miller Avenue, and is adjacent to Turner Reservoir in Rumford, Rhode Island. There are entrances on all sides, with a small parking area at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/196+Pleasant+St,+Rumford,+RI+02916/@41.8360305,-71.3465391,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e45b05370761f3:0x13252985dd0eafe0!8m2!3d41.8360305!4d-71.3459906">the main entrance on Pleasant Street</a>.
<h2>How it came to be</h2>
<p>The original 30â€“acre farm was sold to a developer with plans to build up to 100 condominiums. Financial difficulties forced the developer to declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>With help from private donations, the Nature Conservancy and the R.I. Department of Environmental Management, the BFLT was able to acquire more than half of the farm consisting of 18.8 acres. The City Council changed the parcel to open space, while the remaining acreage was developed into house lots. The farm area is still enjoyed by all today as open field and meadow, with several walking trails.</p>
